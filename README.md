* For Assignment 1, I did the following: 
  * I forked Dr. Tuck's original repository, but I was unable to make it private
  * I changed the name to the repository to include my unity ID
  * I added Dr. Tuck and our TAs as collaborators to the forked repository
  * Now, I have edited this README file
